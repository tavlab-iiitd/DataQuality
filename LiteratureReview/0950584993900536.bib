abstract = {The aim of the paper is to provide a brief review of the program testing technique known as ‘mutation testing’ and outline current research directions in this area. Mutation testing is an example of what is sometimes called an error-based testing technique. In other words, it involves the construction of test data designed to uncover specific errors or classes of errors. A large number of simple changes (mutations) are made to a program, one at a time. Test data then has to be found which distinguishes the mutated versions from the original version. Although the idea was proposed more than a decade ago, it is in some ways still a ‘new’ technique. Originally it was seen by many as costly and somewhat bizarre. However, several variants of the basic method have evolved and these, possibly in conjunction with more efficient techniques for applying the method, can help reduce the cost. Also, by guaranteeing the absence of particular errors, it may be one way to achieve the high reliability necessary in critical software. A further advantage of mutation testing is its universal applicability to all programming languages.}
